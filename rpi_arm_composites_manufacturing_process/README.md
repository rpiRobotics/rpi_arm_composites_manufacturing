#RPI ARM Composites Manufacturing Process

This package contains the process controller for the RPI ARM Composites Manufacturing project. The process controller is an action server but can be run as a script as well.
The process controller action server is normally started via the run.launch file in rpi_arm_composites_manufacturing but can also be started by running process_controller_server
in the scripts folder. To run the process without the action server you should run the pick_and_place_panel file in scripts you must edit this file to work with the panel type you wish to operate on.
